<em>USER_IS_PRESENT</em> looks at presence split across virtual and physical
spaces. It is easy to look at a person on a mobile phone and think that they are
withdrawn or checked out from the world around them; the device has a private screen
and operates on a small scale. But the pace at which someone can navigate their
own device is astonishing; they are running through a personalized experience at
incredible speed without the awareness of the people around them.
<em>USER_IS_PRESENT</em>
captures the motion of the screen and the simultaneous motion of user's body
in the physical world.

To create <em>USER_IS_PRESENT</em>, I further developed <em>phonelovesyoutoo</em>
to capture the screen of the phone while it was in use, in addition to the
front and back cameras.
The same basic
parameters applied: while the phone is in use, it records three video streams. The
streams are later integrated together into a single channel using a custom blending
technique. The result is a collage
that mixes all three video feeds. The rendering techinque creates an effect where the
recordings from device depict a space that is between physical and virtual realties:
it blends elements of user, interface, and environment.

The installation of <em>USER_IS_PRESENT</em> shows three video portraits each
on its own display. The form of the monitors and luminance from the screen suggests
qualities of the phone. The completed
portraits show clips from each person collected in order of the time they were
recorded, but edited to be 30 seconds or less to keep a fast pace through the video.
Each compiled video loop was a different length and the playback of the videos was not synchronized,
allowing interesting juxtapositions to occur by chance. At times, similar physical
spaces are inhabited across different portraits, or similar activities are taking place,
or the same person is texting both subjects. The chance juxtaposition allows different
references to be drawn between the screens at different times.
