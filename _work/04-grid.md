Move the cursor near a square to reveal its identity—or reveal the identity of all squares and see how they change over time.

substrate grid is an updated version of an old sketch to incorporate multiple cursors via <a href="http://www.oblong.com">Oblong</a>’s g-speak pointing app. The attached video shows this sketch working with substrate, a Processing library written to receive gestural data from phones. Colleagues at Oblong, Zai Chang and Alex Valli, wrote an iPhone application that connects to a server and streams user interaction data, including readings from the phone’s accelerometer. The Processing library (co-developed with <a href="http://www.sansumbrella.com">David Wicks</a>) receives the data and uses it to control the data for a pointer. Multiple pointers can be added to an application if multiple phones are connected.
