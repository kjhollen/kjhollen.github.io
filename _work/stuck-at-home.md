<em>Stuck at Home</em> is an interactive work reflecting on the isolation of the COVID
era, searching for (limited) connection through technology. Through a
collection of buttons resembling the layout of a phoneâ€™s home screen, the work
allows the user to browse a collection of cell phone videos taken in and around
my home in Denver. Having moved to the city in 2020 without knowing a lot of
people in the area, this work is an attempt a long distance connection, sharing
the sights and textures of my day to day life in Denver with friends and family
from afar.
