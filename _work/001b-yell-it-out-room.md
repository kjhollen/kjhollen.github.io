<em><a href="https://www.supercharge2020.com/rooms/yelling-room">The Yell It Out Room</a><em>was designed for Supermajority, which is a non-profit organization that supports women’s issues in voting and politics.
The “room” is a website that creates a playful space for the viewer to yell out their frustration.
The project was included in an online event that the organization held to promote US voter registration in September 2020.

Designed in collaboration with <a href="https://qianqian-ye.com/">Qianqian Ye</a>.
