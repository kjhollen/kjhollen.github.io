g-speak draw is an additive & subtractive gestural drawing installation. Performers can select color (black or white) and shape to draw with (circle or line), then squeeze hands (make a fist) to draw. I designed and developed this application as part of the Embodied Computation studio at RISD in 2009, led by instructor Amber Frid-Jimenez.

Though designed with fluid motions in mind, a sculptor visited the space during a small exhibition and repeatedly wrung his hands to create a different style of imagery. The visual output from using the tool varies with the motion of the performer.
