In <em>Uploaded to the Cloud</em>, a computer imagines a sky made of data. Dynamically generated clouds gently move across the frame of the browser window, representing various types of data that can be transmitted by the internet. The clouds are an abstraction of iconography commonly used to represent data and user interactions on the web: likes, hearts, bookmarks, mail envelopes, chat bubbles, alerts, and more. The work is a playful meditation on the metaphors used to describe the transmission of data and its relation to body and place.

This work was created with three.js and lives online at <a href="http://uploadedtothecloud.com">uploadedtothecloud.com</a>. A pre-rendered version of this project was shown at <a href="https://nightlightsdenver.com/">Night Lights Denver</a> in April 2022.
