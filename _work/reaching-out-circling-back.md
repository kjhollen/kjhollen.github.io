<em>Reaching Out, Circling Back</em> is a web-based, game-like experience
about touch and presence
in online spaces. In this project, the visitor completes a series of swipe
gestures and sees the touches of other people visiting the site at the same
time, or those of past visitors. Visitors will never be entirely sure if the
presence of others is real or generated by artificial intelligence.
