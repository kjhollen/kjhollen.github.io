Using the same capture software and data from <em>phonelovesyoutoo: matrix</em>,
I created a single-channel durational video work to play all of the collected
video in real time: from both the front and back camera. The frame of the video
contains 30 cells arranged like a calendar; one column for each day of the week
and one row for each week in the month.
Each cell contains a diptych of front and back camera videos from the corresponding
days. The clips play during the time of day they were recorded. When a clip finishes
playing, its brightness fades and the last frame remains, frozen. The video restarts
at 6am every day, starting from a black frame and illuminating when the first clip of
the day appears.

Where <em>phonelovesyoutoo: matrix</em> felt overwhelming in its scale and volume
of activity, this work has a lot of quiet moments where nothing is happening at all.
There are times in the 24-hour cycle where no clips are playing; instead, each
frame is faded and frozen in time. The frozen frames are left behind to give a sense
of presence of other clips even when they are not playing. Instead, a sense of anxiety
comes from wondering when the next clip will pop up.
