Tangle is a simple gestural sketch that draws lines between the left and right hands of two participants. Lines follow participants hands in real time.

Tangle was designed & developed as part of the Embodied Computation studio at RISD. Other studio members created physical objects and body wear to test with this application (and other similar applications). Classmate Er-ti Chen designed body wear to constrain movement while working with this space (see two-person sleeves below).
