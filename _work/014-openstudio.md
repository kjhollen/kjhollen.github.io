Openstudio was an online experiment in collaboration, creativity, and capitalism created by the <a href="http://plw.media.mit.edu/">Physical Language Workshop</a> at the MIT Media Lab, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmaeda">John Maeda</a>.
Members of the community could commission, buy, and sell digital artworks created with a simple online drawing tool.
The website launched in 2005 and ran until 2008.

Openstudio team: <a href="http://burak-arikan.com/">Burak Arikan</a>, Annie Ding, <a href="http://brentfitzgerald.com/">Brent Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="http://www.amberfj.com/">Amber Frid-Jimenez</a>, <a href="http://www.katehollenbach.com/">Kate Hollenbach</a>, <a href="http://kellegous.com/">Kelly Norton</a>, and more.
