<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _work/005-mezzanine.md %}">Mezzanine</a> is a collaborative conference room product from <a href="http://www.oblong.com">Oblong Industries</a> with interfaces for mobile devices, laptops, and large scale displays.
Users can interact with the shared screens in the conference room through their personal devices or a gestural wand.
The user interface across all platforms has a cohesive look and feel, designed to be minimally obtrusive and let the user's content shine.
In 2015, the Oblong design team updated the user interfaces for various platforms to be more consistent and I was the creative director for the project.
