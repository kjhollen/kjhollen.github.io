The human relationship with the smartphone is an intimate one. The smartphone is a private display in a public space; a one-to-one relationship between person and screen. Even without the anthropomorphization of digital assistants like Siri, an emotional connection exists between user and device. Throughout the day, the user gazes at the phone. Does the phone gaze back? What if it did?

<i>phonelovesyoutoo</i> is an immersive video matrix that captures my cellphone usage over a period of one month. Over 1000 videos from the phone's front facing camera are tiled across 3 walls. To create the video, I developed an Android application to automatically record video from the front and back camera of the phone every time the phone was in use (when the screen is unlocked). After a month of use, I’d amassed between 30–90 minutes of footage a day with an average of 30 videos today. Most videos are short: less than 30 seconds to respond to an email or fire off a text message. Longer durations result from activities like reading articles and using the GPS to trek across Los Angeles in rush hour.

Each tile in the matrix captures habits, expressions, and neuroses. With the face in the frame, there is room for little else, but noticeable differences are present: rumpled hair and puffy eyes in the morning, red lipstick for an evening out, wet hair after a shower. The context changes but the face mostly stays the same: it is a blank expression, a concentrating expression, the kind of vacant look reserved only for glowing screens. People around us do not see these faces; they take in the rest of our bodies and can't make eye contact because the viewer's eyes are cast down. The video matrix here removes that barrier and shows directly how a person looks when looking at a phone.

<!--

<i>phonelovesyoutoo</i> is inspired by my professional work as an interface designer for mobile phones and collaborative spaces. The work emerges from a desire to understand why and how we are drawn to phones, the new habits we form while using them, and the effect on our emotional psyche.

The rhythm of the <i>phonelovesyoutoo</i> channels the anxiety of our present age in capitalism: everything is in a constant motion. No one tile is able to hold the viewer's sustained attention; the eye is immediately drawn to another tile where something else is happening simultaneously. In the mean time, the subject of the video is going about what Hito Steyerl would call junktime commitments.\autocite{Junktime} Like the television in Vito Acconci's time, the phone is now the capitalistic symbol of the future; it is ``out-dated at the very moment it's looked at'' and ready to be replaced by the latest and greatest from Apple.\autocite{Acconci} Is the phone now the absence of a body?-->
