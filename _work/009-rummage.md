Rummage is an image sorting & collating demo for <a href="http://www.oblong.com">Oblong</a>'s g-speak. Images are arranged in various configurations in 3D space and controlled by hand gestures.

I curated the image collection for this application, programmed/designed an interface for sorting the images by color, and designed some supporting graphics for "clipping" the set to selected images with two hands.

See Rummage in action in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_underkoffler_drive_3d_data_with_a_gesture?language=en">John Underkoffler's TED talk</a>.
