<em>Computer Visions</em> is a print series that analyzes videos collected using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _work/003b-phonelovesyoutoo-matrix.md %}">phonelovesyoutoo</a> and abstracts them using the visual language of computer vision algorithms.
The images blend elements of the digital and physical environment captured by the device.
