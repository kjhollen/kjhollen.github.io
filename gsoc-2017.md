[DRAFT / work in progress]

Well this summer I worked on p5.js as part of Google Summer of Code.

We kept a shared branch on github, [WebGL_GSOC17](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/commits/WebGL_GSOC17), to compile changes that Stalgia and I were both making to the project (if you want to see my changes in isolation, [you can do so here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/commits/WebGL_GSOC17?author=kjhollen)).

## Collating
Stalgia initiated a [planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yMTNsNN2QEhKY2NRNSaxsMCntMzIAuL3eR2_E9ylthc/edit?usp=sharing) for us to track open issues and feature requests alongside our own observations about what was needed in the p5.js Web GL feature set. As we were learning the webgl part of the codebase, we kept notes here.

## Prioritizing

Looking at our todolist, it became clear that we couldn't tackle all of the feature requests/enhancements and architecture improvements in just the summer.
We made another [document detailing goals and priorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZT27SS_NmVv4c7-2x9_H44xQ7UNmf1wuTpcAraHmB7c/edit?usp=sharing) for the webgl codebase,
So it became an important goal to work on re-structuring the library with future expansions in mind and to make it easier for new contributors to understand the code and join the project.

## Architecture
I developed a few new abstractions to add to the webgl library.
Code having to do with shaders and textures was modularized moved into its own files, making it easier to understand the webgl workflow and to optimize performance.

### p5.Shader
The [p5.Shader](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/WebGL_GSOC17/src/webgl/p5.Shader.js) object provides access to the uniforms and attributes of a GL program, compiles and links the program, and provides an API to set up the shader program for rendering.

### p5.Texture
The [p5.Texture](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/WebGL_GSOC17/src/webgl/p5.Texture.js) object handles converting various format (images and videos) to webgl textures.

### Custom Shaders
[TODO: writing]

[TODO: embed video texture sketch]

### Performance
With new abstractions in place for shaders and textures, it was easier to track down performance bottlenecks in the webgl code.
Previous slowdowns had been made because it was difficult to deduce context, so instead, the code often did more work than it needed to (for example, the first bug I fixed this summer was speeding up calls to begin/endShape, which created a new shader every single frame).

[TODO: embed many triangles sketch / or gif link to sketch?]

[TODO: embed many textures sketch / or gif link to sketch?]

## Documentation
[TODO: link to p5 wiki]

## Future Work

See [Open issues for p5 + WebGL](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl).

### Text Rendering
The new p5.Texture API was designed with a future implementation of the text() feature in mind.
Using [this article](https://www.eventbrite.com/engineering/its-2015-and-drawing-text-is-still-hard-webgl-threejs/) as a guide, I'd like to implement texture-based rendering of text in webgl mode.

### Camera Library
I did some experimental work with adding a lookAt-like feature for the camera in webgl mode, in [my camera-wip branch](https://github.com/kjhollen/p5.js/tree/camera-wip).
Stalgia found a lightweight library that many other Javascript WebGL libraries use for camera abstractions, and we thought it would be better to move forward with that library.
It has seen a lot of us and testing; more than we could hope to do by completing our camera and matrix library implementation.
We hope future contributors will help us build this feature!
