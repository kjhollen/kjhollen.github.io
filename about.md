I am a media artist working with interactive systems and new technologies. My art practice explores the relationship of technology, gesture, and motion. I am currently
a graduate student in the <a href="http://dma.ucla.edu">Design Media Arts</a> program at UCLA.

In the past, I was the Director of Design and Computation at 
<a href="http://www.oblong.com">Oblong Industries</a>, where I led an interdisciplinary 
team of designers and programmers building interfaces for collaborative spaces, incorporating large-scale displays and gesture tracking technology. I also studied
<a href="http://gd.risd.edu">Graphic Design</a> at the
<a href="http://www.risd.edu">Rhode Island School of Design</a> for a little while,
worked as a graduate researcher in <a href="http://our.risd.edu">John Maeda</a>'s
research group, the
<a href="http://plw.media.mit.edu">Physical Language Workshop</a> at the
<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, and earned a B.Sc. in Computer
Science and Engineering from <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a>.
