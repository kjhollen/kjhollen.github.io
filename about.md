I am a designer and programmer interested in information visualization and
interaction design for new technologies. I work at 
<a href="http://www.oblong.com">Oblong Industries</a> as the Director of Design
&amp; Computation. Oblong builds g-speak, a platform for building gestural
interfaces and interactions with multiple users, screens, and devices.
It's a great deal of fun (and we are <a href="http://oblong.com/jobs">hiring</a>).

Before joining Oblong,
I studied <a href="http://gd.risd.edu">Graphic Design</a> at the
<a href="http://www.risd.edu">Rhode Island School of Design</a> for a little while,
worked as a graduate researcher in <a href="http://our.risd.edu">John Maeda</a>'s
research group, the
<a href="http://plw.media.mit.edu">Physical Language Workshop</a> at the
<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, and earned a B.Sc. in Computer
Science and Engineering from <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a>.
